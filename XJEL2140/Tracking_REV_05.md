## Antenna
- Dishes
- Terrestrial (UHF)
- Sector
- Radar
  - Pulsed Radar &rArr; Distance
  - Doppler Radar &rArr; Speed!
- Adaptive Phased Array (Electronically Steered)
  - Beam Forming Network
  - &rArr; Virtual Phased Array (Synthetic Aperture) &nbsp; **Using Motion**

## Antenna Gain
Omnidirectional = *isotropic*

To steer the wave, use *bulb & parabollic reflector*


> The Unit:
> ## `dBi`  
> `i` refers to *isotropic*  
> $$G(dBi)=10 \log (\eta \frac{\pi^2 D^2}{\lambda^2})$$
